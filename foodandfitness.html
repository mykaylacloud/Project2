<p> Here are some evidence-based tips for maintaining a healthy lifestyle, focusing on both nutrition and exercise:

<li> Limit Sugary Drinks: Cut down on sodas, fruit juices, and sweetened teas. These beverages are a major source of added sugar and can increase the risk of heart disease and type 2 diabetes. Opt for water, unsweetened teas, sparkling water, or coffee instead. </li>

<li> Include Nuts and Seeds: Despite their fat content, nuts and seeds are highly nutritious. They provide protein, fiber, vitamins, and minerals. Incorporating them into your diet may help with weight loss and reduce the risk of heart disease and type 2 diabetes. </li>

<li> Avoid Ultra-Processed Foods (UPFs): UPFs are modified foods with additives like sugar, refined oils, and artificial ingredients. Theyâ€™re often low in nutrients and high in calories. Limit consumption of items  like snack cakes, fast food, and packaged cookies. Opt for whole, minimally processed foods instead. </li>

<li> Fuel Your Workouts: If you exercise in the morning, have a healthy breakfast at least one hour before your workout. </li>

<li> Portion Size: Be mindful of how much you eat before you exercise to avoid feeling sluggish or low on energy. </li> 

<li> Snack Well: Choose nutritious pre-workout snacks like smoothies or yogurt with fruit. </li>
  
<li> Post-Exercise Nutrition: Refuel with a balanced meal after your workout, including protein and carbohydrates. </li>

Remember, consistency and balance are key to achieving and maintaining a healthy lifestyle! Meal prepping and planning out your meals are an ideal habit to ensure you reach your goals.
