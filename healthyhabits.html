    <header><h2>Healthy Habits</h2></header>
    <ul>
        <li>Regular Exercise: Creating a workout split is an important step in improving your overall well-being. These can include walking, cardio, strength training, and recreational sports like swimming, soccer, basketball, etc. Just prioritizing 30 minutes to an 1 hour of physical activity can help you reach your goal.</li>
        <li>Hydration: Staying hydrated is an important step for body recompositing. You can download any water tracker app to help you reach your daily goal.</li>
        <li>Balanced Nutrition: Make sure you are incorporating a balanced diet. Seven essential factors are needed for a balanced diet. These are carbs, protein, fat, fiber, vitamins, minerals, and water.</li>
        <li>Mindfulness and Meditation: Please prioritize mental health. Mental health plays a huge role in fitness. This is why I recommend mindfulness and meditation. A great app I use is the CALM app. This has many features that help teach you how to meditate and practice self-care strategies.</li>
        <li>Adequate Sleep: Quality sleep not only helps your ability to workout and train better but function throughout the day. If you have trouble sleeping, I recommend magnesium vitamins or a nighttime routine that helps you wind down. I always recommend everyone to get at least 8 hours of sleep, when they are on a fitness journey.</li>
        <li>Social Connections: Sometimes starting out in fitness, it can be difficult to take that big step. This is why I recommend reaching out to either family, friends, or any local clubs. There are many resources you can search if you need an accountability partner to propel your fitness journey forward.</li>
        <li>Positive Affirmations: Create a space for positive affirmations or motivational quotes. I always have post-it notes and I write affirmations and quotes daily. I place these on my mirror and it motivates me every day. This world is tough, so reminding yourself that you are worthy and beautiful inside and out helps a ton.</li>
        <li>Regular Check-ups: Please schedule regular health check-ups and screenings with your physician. This can help you make sure your diet and workout regime is beneficial to your overall well-being.</li>
    </ul>
