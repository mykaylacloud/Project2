<header><h2>Healthy Habits</h2></header>

<p> Incorporating healthy habits into your daily routine can significantly improve your overall well-being.

<li> Regular Exercise: Creating a workout split is an important step in improving your overall well-being. These can include walking, cardio, strength training, and recreational sports like swimming, soccer, basketball, etc. Just prioritizing 30 minutes to an 1 hour of physical activity can help you reach your goal. </li>

<li> Hydration: Staying hydrated is an important step for body recompositing. You can download any water tracker app to help you reach your daily goal.</li>

<li> Balanced Nutrition: Make sure you are incorporating a balanced diet. Seven essential factors are needed for a balanced diet. These are carbs, protein, fat, fiber, vitamins, minerals, and water. </li>
 
<li> Mindfulness and Meditation: Please prioritize mental health. Mental health plays a huge role in fitness. This is why i recommend mindfulness and meditation. A great app I use is the CALM app. This has many features that help teach you how to meditate and practice self-care strategies. </li>

<li> Adequate Sleep: Quality sleep not only helps your ability to workout and train better but function throughout the day. If you have trouble sleeping, I recommend magnesium vitamins or a nighttime routine that helps you wind down. I always recommend everyone to get at least 8 hours of sleep, when they are on a fitness journey. </li>

<li> Social Connections: Sometimes starting out in fitness, it can be difficult to take that big step. This is why I recommend to reach out to either family, friends, or any local clubs. There are many resources you can search if you need an accountability partner to propel your fitness journey forward. </li>

<li> Positive Affirmations: Create a space for positive affirmations or motivational quotes. I always have post-it notes and I write affirmations and quotes daily. I place these on my mirror and it motivates me everyday. This world is tough, so reminding yourself that you are worthy and beautiful inside and out helps a ton. </li>

<li> Regular Check-ups: Please schedule regular health check-ups and screenings with your physician. This can help you make sure your diet and workout regime is beneficial to your overall well-being.</li>
